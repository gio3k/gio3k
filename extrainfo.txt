I'm a 17-year-old university student currently residing in Perth, Western Australia. I started coding when I was given a copy of Visual Studio 2005 on DVD at 6 years old. Since then, I've been programming for fun as a hobby (well, really the main thing I do). Feel free to check out the projects Iâ€™m working on!
